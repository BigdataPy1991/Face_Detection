# Face_Detection

OBJECTIVE: 

Real-time face recognition with OpenCV and Python

PREREQUISITE:

numpy==1.18.5
opencv-python==4.2.0.34

CODE BRIEFING :

This Code for Face detection is performed using the Haar Classifier for face detection.The detection works only on grayscale images and so we are converting the color image to grayscale in our code.Code generates 2 files.
      1.First text file with the number of Faces detected and the timestamp.
      2.Second file contains an image with the Face detected highlightedi n a Rectangular Frame.

ENHANCEMENTS :

The code can be furthur enhanced using the Deep learning and Machine learning algorithms(Eg:Tensorflow) for Facial detection,Facial comparision and facial recognitoin against a trained dataset.
